The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build is failing due to a missing script "build:client" while trying to execute `npm run build:client` at line [86](#L86) of the build logs.

### Solution
1. Verify that the "build:client" script is correctly defined in your `package.json` file or your project's build configuration.
2. If the script is missing, add the "build:client" script to your `package.json` file under "scripts" section.
   
```json
"scripts": {
  "build:client": "your build client command here"
}
```

3. After adding the script, commit the changes and trigger the build again.
